The project we are developing is a top-down, horror themed RPG game. My partner and I started developing this project after playing games like Sen’s '<i>Mad Father</i>', and Makoto Kedōin’s '<i>Corpse Party</i>', and parts of Edmund McMillen’s '<i>The Binding of Isaac</i>'. Using those games as inspiration for our project, we set out to develop a game where the user will be both heart-wrenched and terrified while playing. Ultimately, we want our game to be a distraction from life, and give a little challenge for people to overcome.
