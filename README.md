The project we are developing is a top-down, horror themed RPG game. My partner and I started developing this project after playing games like Sen’s Mad Father, and Makoto Kedōin’s Corpse Party, and parts of Edmund McMillen’s The Binding of Isaac. Using those games as inspiration for our project, we set out to develop a game where the user will be both heart-wrenched and terrified while playing. Ultimately, we want our game to be a distraction from life, and give a little challenge for people to overcome.
